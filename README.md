<p>An experience you can't forget</p>

This repository contains custom CSS styles for enhancing the appearance of the Vivaldi browser. These styles are designed to modify the look of various elements, including the tab bar, tab positioning, favicon sizes, button toolbars, and more.

## Installation

To apply these custom styles to your Vivaldi browser, follow these steps:
1. Go to [vivaldi://experiments/](vivaldi://experiments)
1. Enable 'Allow CSS modification'
1. Clone this repo
1. Open Settings > Appearance > Custom Ui modifications
1. Select the folder where you cloned this repo
1. Done. Now open a new instance of vivaldi to verify whether the styles have been applied.
> Note: You have to switch the tabar position to left before using this stylesheet for a better experience. Also note that the stylesheets are not responsive as the sizes are written in pixels; so you might have to tinker with them a bit.

## Future Goals:
1. Fix the workspace popup(currently it stays in the middle of the tabbar)
1. Add ambiance to the window based on the website visited(will be very hard for me now)

## Contributions:
- Please raise an issue if you find something buggy while using this stylesheet
- Your PRs to add features or fix the issues will be highly appreciated
